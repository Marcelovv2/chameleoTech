Evaluate your idea in the early stages, prototyping is a great tool to validate your idea or to sell it to investors.  

## Prototyping

Either if you are trying to explore a concept or you want to get serious with your app project, there is a prototype that can help you, we can work with you in: 

1. Determine the needs and the goals.
2. Build the prototype (high or low fidelity).
3. Evaluate the prototype.

Depending on the stage of your project you can benefit from prototypes in multiple ways.

- Validation
- Negation
- New discoveries

## Deliverables
- Low fidelity prototypes, this doesn't have interactions but serves as a guide for what things might look and the flows are implemented
- Medium Fidelity, this has interactions and could have some branding on them.
- High Fidelity, this has interactions and data it's more useful for advance stages in a project.
